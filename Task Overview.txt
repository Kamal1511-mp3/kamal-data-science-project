Let's start by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of our choice. For this demonstration, I'll use the Iris dataset, which is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable (species).

We will:

Load the data.
Perform basic summary statistics.
Explore distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
Visualize findings using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
